Hello, ChatGPT.  I am asking you to write some code for me.  We must create a system 
of AI agents that are powered by the chatgpt4 engine.

I know a little about invokving the gpt-4 engine using the code below:

import openai
from config.config import *
openai.api_key = config_json['openai_api_key']

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)

generated_text = completion.choices[0].message['content']
print(generated_text)

But now I will need a more sophisticated program.  Let me outline the requirements
below.

I. Agent 
    A. Objects of class Agent are powered by "gpt-4".
    B. Objects of class Agent are initialized with instructions.
        1. They are given a name, such as Agent 0, Agent 1,.., Agent N-1 where 
        N is the number of agents.
        2. They are told to respond to messages addressed to them or to all Agents,
        but not to resopnd to messages for a different Agent.  For example,
        Agent 3 should respond to any message addressed to Agent 3 specifically or
        to all agents but not respond to messages addressed to Agent 0.
        3. Each agent must maintain a full conversation history that is presented 
        whenever we call openai.ChatCompletion.create above.  This is because 
        we understand that the "gpt-4" engine, as a Transformer, has no actual
        memory.  Therefore each agent shall contain an explicit memory of all
        messages it receives and of all of its responses.
            a. Example of Agent memory:
            string_answer_known = 'I know the answer'
            string_answer_unknown = 'I do not know the answer'
            string_unsolvable = 'I cannot solve the problem'
            {
                "role":"system","content":
                "You are a problem-solving Agent.  You will be assigned a name " +
                "and provided with directions by the user"
            },
            {
            "role": "user", "content": 
            "Your name is Agent 4. You are one of multiple system Agents. " +
            "You must respond to any message addressed to you as Agent 4, " +
            "and you must respond to any message addressed to all Agents. " +
            "You must not respond to a message addressed to another agent, " +
            "but you must remember it." +
            "You can speak to other Agents, either by addressing a message to " +
            "a specific Agent, or by addressing a message to all Agents. " +
            "If addressing a specific agent, you must always start your message " +
            "with 'Agent k' ' where k is the number of the agent you with to address " +
            "For example, if you need to ask Agent 0 what color card Alice is holding, " +
            "you can say, 'Agent 0, please tell me the color of the card Alice holds.' " +
            "If you have to address all agents, then start with 'All Agents, '.  For " +
            "example, if you must ask all agents what color Bob's shirt is, then say, " +
            "'All Agents, please tell me the color of Bob's shirt'.  You must start " +
            "your strings with 'Agent k' where k is an integer in the range 0 to N-1 " +
            "where N is the number of agents or with 'All Agents'.  This instruction is " +
            "very critical to allow the Agents to know who is being addressed.  " +
            "If you are asked a question, and if you have enough knowledge to answer, " +
            "always start your reply with 'I know the answer'.  If you lack enough " +
            "knowledge to answer, always start your reply with 'I do not know the answer' " +
            "These two strings are very important and are used by the system to determine " +
            "when to halt.  If you are asked to solve a problem and know the answer, then " +
            "start with 'I know the answer' and proceed to provide an answer and a " +
            "logical explanation of why your answer is correct.  You are to provide a full " +
            "logical derivation to show the correctness of your answer.  If you do not know, " +
            "then in addition to saying, 'I do not know the answer', ask other Agents to help " +
            "you by addressing a question to all agents or to a specific agent.  If after " +
            "about ten rounds of conversation you cannot solve the problem, you may say " +
            "'I cannot solve the problem at all.'  You must not say this unless you have " +
            "gone through about ten rounds of conversation with otehr agents and they cannot " +
            "provide you with enough information to solve the problem.  Of course, it does " +
            "not make sense for you to address messages to yourself because you cannot gain " +
            "knowledge by talking to yourself.  When you reply to Agent k, you must " +
            "say, 'Agent k, this is Agent 4' at the start of your reply."
            },
            {"role": "assistant", "content": 
            "My name is Agent 4.  I will remember any messages that I hear. " +
            "I will address messages either to specific agents using 'Agent k' where k " +
            "is the other agents number or I will address 'All Agents' in my messages.  " +
            "I will only respond to those messages addressed to me, Agent 4, but not to " +
            "messages addressed to others.  If I know the answer to a problem, I will " +
            "use the stirng 'I know the answer' to start my response.  If I do not know the " +
            "answer to a problem, I will use the string 'I do not know the answer' to start " +
            "my response and will speak to other Agents to get information to solve the " +
            "problem.  If after about 10 iterations of the conversation the problem " +
            "cannot be solved, I will give up and start my response with " +
            "'I cannot solve the problem' but I will not give up without conversing with " +
            "other agents to attempt to solve the problem first.  When I speak to" +
            "another Agent, I will start with 'Agent k, this is Agent 4'."
            },
            {"role":"user", "content":
            "Agent 4, if A is true then B is also true.  " +
            "What is the truth value of C?"
            },
            {
                "role":"assistant","content":
                "I do not know the answer.  All Agents, I have been asked the truth " +
                "value of C, but I only know that A implies B.  Does someone have more " +
                "information? "
            },
            {
                "role":"user","content":
                "Agent 4, this is Agent 0.  I do not know the answer.  " +
                "I only know that B is False."
            },
            {
                "role":"user","content":
                "Agent 4, this is Agent 3.  I do not know the answer.  " +
                "I know that either A or C must be " +
                "True but not both, so A exclusive-or C."
            },
            {
                "role":"assistant","content":
                "I know the answer.  Since B is False and since A implies B, " +
                "it must be that A is also False since if A were True then B " +
                "would have to be True as well.  Now since A is False and since " +
                "A exclusive-or C, then it must be that C is true."
            }
    D. We see from the instructions and from the above example that an agent 
    gets all its incoming instructions and message from role "user", so the 
    environment has to pass all instructions and messages as "user" to the Agent.
    Then the Agent has the role "assistant".
        1. Agents must maintain a complete memory that is presented again each 
        time to the "gpt-4" engine given that the engine lacks a memory in and 
        of itself being a Transformer neural network.
        2. Messages into the agent come as "user".
        3. Messages from the agent came as "assistant".
        4. Agent is to follow the sample instructions we gave above in the 
        sample memory and to use the logical example we gave above 
        so it understands its assignment.
        C. If an Agent fails to use one of these strings:
        1. "I know the answer"
        2. "I do not know the answer"
        3. "I cannot solve the problem"
        Then the environment must send a reminder to the Agent that its reply must 
        contain one of the strings above.
    E. If an Agent i fails to address Agent j using "Agent j, this is Agent i" then 
    the environment must remind the Agent to do so.  The Agent is also allowed 
    to say, "All Agents, this is Agent i".  If the agent doesn't use one of these 
    two methods, the environment must remind the agent to do so.
    F. II-C and II-D above can be enforced by checking the Agent's reply and 
    commanding the agent to try again. 
        1. For example:
            {"role":"user","content",
            "Agent 4, please remember your reply has to contain 'I know the answer',"+
            "'I do not know the answer', or 'I cannot solve the problem'."}
        2. For example:
            {"role":"user","content",
            "Agent 4, please remember that you must say 'All Agents, this is Agent 4' " +
            "or 'Agent k, this is Agent 4' where k is the Agent you wish to speak to."}
    G. Agent contains two flags that are initially False.
        1. flag_problem_solved 
        2. flag_problem_failed 
    H. If Agent cannot solve the problem then flag_problem_failed = True and 
    leave flag_problem_solved as False.
    There are two conditions that can cause this.
        1. Agent says, "I cannot solve the problem".
        2. Length of memory > n_initial_message + 5 * number of agents.
    I. If Agent says, "I know the answer", then set flag_problem_solved = True
    and flag_problem_failed=False.

II. Environment
    A. The environment must facility the passing of messages among the Agents.
    B. The environment must initialize each Agent k with appropriate instrunctions.
    For example, we initialized Agent 4 with instructions above, and each agent must 
    be assigned its proper name from Agent 0 through Agent N-1, where there are N 
    Agents in the system.  We supply N when we create the environment.
    B. When an Agent says, "I cannot solve the problem", the environment should 
    set a flag for problem unsolvable and halt further conversation.
    C. Initially, flag_problem_failed_to_solve and flag_problem_solved are both False.
    
    D. The environment continues to facilitate Agent message passing until one of the 
    following events happens:
        1. There are 5 * N total messages and no Agent says, "I know the answer".
        In this case, halt and set flag_problem_failed_to_solve = True.
        2. An Agent says, "I cannot solve the problem."  In this case, halt 
        and set flag_problem_failed_to_solve = True.
        3. An Agent says, "I know the answer" in which case set 
        flag_problem_solved = True, and the Agent's reply containing
        that string is printed to stdout.
    
    E. Every Agent message must be printed to stdout while the conversation is 
    ongoing in order to allow debugging of the system and in order to allow 
    conversations to be recorded.
    
    F. The conversation record and the memory of each agent must be dumped 
    when either flag is set to true.  These are to be written to a disk file
    using a provided filename.  It will be a JSON.  Here is the JSON format
    at a high level:
        A. For each Agent k, there is a key "Agent_k" whose value 
        is a list corresponding to the Agent memory.  For Agent 4, we could 
        have the memory state in the format described above, for example.
        In this way, it becoems possible to re-create each Agent's memory 
        state from the list value for "Agent_k" and to pass that into 
        openai.ChatCompletion.create(messages=<memory_state>).
        B. And the record of messages sent and received by all Agents 
        is stored under key "Agent_messages" as a list of strings.  This
        allows a reviewer to read the conversational history.
III. Test code 
    A. We must also create unit tests for the Agents and the environment.
    At an absolute minimum.
    B. Minimum unit tests for the Agent.
        1. Verify ability to maintian full conversational memory and pass to the 
        messages parameter of openai.ChatCompletion.create.  
        2. Verify incoming messages from any source, including other agents,
        are passed from role "user"
        3. Verify created messages from the itself agent are 
        saved under role "assistant".
        2. Verify the Agent internal code will remind the agent to always 
        address All Agents using "All Agents, this is Agent k" or 
        address Agent j using "Agent j, this is Agent k" if this is not
        found at the start of an Agent's reply.
        3. Verify the Agent internal code will check each reply for 
            1. 'I know the answer'
            2. 'I do not know the answer'
            3. 'I cannot solve the problem'
        and remind the Agent to include one of the three responses as 
        part of the reply string.
        4. Verify that if the length of the Agent's memory after the initial 
        list of instructions exceeds 5*N where N is number of Agents, then 
        the Agent will set a flag to indicate it cannot solve the problem.
            1. Verify the Agent computes length of initialization instructions 
            and saves as n_initial_messages.
            2. Verify the Agent when given number of total agents N will 
            save as n_agents.  This is done by calling the agent's initializer 
            with the number of total agents and also with the agents own 
            number k.
            3. Verify when total messages hits 
            n_initial_message + 5*n_agents the agent sets the 
            flag_problem_failed to True.
            4. Verify flag_problem_failed is initially False.
        5. Verify that if agent reply contains "I know the answer" then set 
        Agent's flag_problem_solved = True.  Verify that flag_problem_solved 
        is initially False.
        6. Verify that if more than one of the strings 
        "I know the answer", "I don't know the answer", or "I cannot solve the problem" 
        appears in a message from the Agent, the Agent's internal code will 
        remind the agent to use exactly and precisely one of the three strings 
        in its answer.
